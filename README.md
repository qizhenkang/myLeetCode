# myLeetCode

This _Zhenkang[^1]_'s _LeetCode_ Repository(mainly by _Python_).

When I entered my Ph.D. career, I found that what I love is not researching, but programming.
Therefore, I decided to start the journey of _LeetCode_.
It is not among core scientific researches, but a little source of happiness in the boring rearch career.
At the same time, it may have some other effects. For instance, it may be helpful for seaking employment or my career advancement.

<!-- confront the uncertainty about the economic outlook -->

<!-- career advancement / seek employment -->
