# myLeetCode

This _Zhenkang_[^my]'s _LeetCode_ Repository(mainly by _Python_).

I started the journey of _LeetCode_ when I was in the second year of my Ph.D.[^why].

## Statistics

**Big data** is changing the **world**. In this page, some data of my studying progress are collected and showed.

### Distribution of Learning Time in One Day

I read the modification time of each solution file by _Python_ and analyzed my study time.

## My Coding Record

### Learning Record

In weekly contest 263, the fourth problem is about **Breadth-first search**(BFS), which I was not familiar with.

Therefore, a note about [Search](./note/Not_001_Search.md) is written to summarize the key points of _DFS_/_Backtracking_/_BFS_.

### Cumulative Curve

I read the modification time of each solution file by _Python_ and analyzed the Cumulative Curve.

### Solved Problems List

All my solved problems are listed here. For searching and reviewing easily, the difficulty, status and addressed time are recorded.

For example, the first recorded problem is **twoSum**, whose difficulty is **Easy**. The time when got _ACCEPTED_ is _2020/12/04_.
Meanwhile, the classification and the self-rating score on the problem are recorded.
